Iraq is a Shia-majority country but was ruled by Sunnis during Saddam's rule. Syria is a Sunni-majority country but is ruled by a Shia family. Most Middle Eastern countries have a Sunni majority in general, but the Hezbollah in Lebanon is a Shia group and while Lebanon has more Sunnis than Shi'ites, the Sunnis only barely beat the Shi'ites and the Shia population is still important. The Houthis mainly consist of Zaydis (Zaydi Islam being a branch of Shia Islam) while the Yemeni government consists of Sunnis.

Meaning no handouts, just kick you to the curb and succeed or fail on your own efforts, survival of the fittest? The 'patriarchy' that's oppressing women as it's been called is now gone, so is the sheltering from hardships it once gave. Society has existed for past couple thousands of years by prejudice, discrimination, oppression, war and the list continues. As men we have learned to live with this.  There is no top of the ladder without putting someone under a boot, but women want their equality. We want It too because it's less burden for us but don't you think that your equal shot at the top should come with an equal dose of the hardship?  How can you want the benefits without the effort and act like it's some targeted thing. Like women aren't more likely to be the abusive one in a relationship? Like they're not the ones who usually lift a hand first? Like they're not using suggestive behavior to get attention,often flaunting themselves as sexual objects but complain when they're treated as such. Just look at the behavior of the average woman and think, if a man did the same he'd be in some deep deep waters all the time.\n","Women get so much leniency and still they talk about not being equal.  Look at how much profit women bring to a company compared to a man, look at how many would take  the highest paying dead end job as opposed to starting from the bottom on the longshot that they could grind it out to the top. Even simpler, look at how many female truckers there are, look at a high-rise construction and see how many females are risking an ugly end. Look at how many want to be high risk doctors where their years of work could end in one bad call or just how many are on the 'lost at sea' tombstones. Thats where the money is, the difficult spots. Rather than go out there and make it happen by any means, thinking about what they could build out of what they have, most care about what they can get and what exists to be given for their efforts.  At this point, the only thing preventing real equality is the average female mindset. Life and the people in it  aren't supposed to be nice to you. There is a saying, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Feminists need to stop complaining about lemons and learn to make that lemonade.\n","ùó™ùóµùòÜ ùóóùóºùó≤ùòÄ ùó™ùóÆùóø ùóòùòÖùó∂ùòÄùòÅ? ùóúùòÄ ùóúùòÅ ùó¶ùóºùó∫ùó≤ùòÅùóµùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùóóùó≤ùó≤ùóΩùóπùòÜ ùóúùó∫ùóΩùóπùóÆùóªùòÅùó≤ùó± ùó∂ùóª ùóõùòÇùó∫ùóÆùóª ùó°ùóÆùòÅùòÇùóøùó≤?\n","\n","War exists because the universe is made up of two opposing forces: reception and bestowal.

As the majority of documented Union rape cases were Northerners seeing black women for the first time in their lives fetishizing them and expecting \"appreciation\" for being their \"liberators\". Many soldiers were shot on the spot by officers in these scenarios. The most well documented case I could find is that of Margaret Brooks who was 24 when she was rape by 3 white New Jersey cavalrymen at gunpoint after her wagon broke and the driver had gone to get help. African American women were more likely to be targeted because in a sense they were the most invisible individuals at the time. Southern White women could report to the authorities and more likely be heard by the higher ups. So soldiers would rape the women who might not even know who their own parents are or when they were born. That part of the civil war is often over looked because it doesnt go withthe narrative of Union soldiers being benevolent to southern blacks.

Can anyone explain how the goal keeper touching the divers foot stopped a goal scoring opportunity? Kicking the ball out of play and then making sure the goal keeper makes contact with your foot should never be a penalty anywhere.  Some sanity has to be brought to these sorts of situations to stop the obvious corruption of players and officials. The Palace player went dow far to easily and yet there was contact and it was a goal scoring opportunity but the ref bottled it because of kit sales abroad and pressure from the powers.

This culture (USA and the west generally) over-values professional success, monetary gain and physical prowess and undervalues emotional sensitivity, focus on family and children and nurturing  relationships (these lists could be expanded). And generally speaking, men as a group natively focus on the former, and women as a group focus on the latter. This is the main reason why women are undervalued. So the women's movement solution is to abandon the latter for the former, calling all women to become more like men, even transing to become men. This movement just perpetuates the devaluing of women all the more. A true women't movement would celebrate those values held most dear in the heart of women as a group, and challenge this culture's over-valuing of male characteristics.\n","Who's here after Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to stop their proxy war thanks to China's mediation?\n","How can we have VAR and still get decisions completely wrong.
