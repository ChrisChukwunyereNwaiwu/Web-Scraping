# Web Scraping Project

## Overview
This project focuses on web scraping using Python. The objective is to extract structured data from various websites, which can be used for analytics, monitoring, or automating tasks. The project uses popular Python libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` to retrieve and parse HTML content, as well as handle pagination, dynamic content, and data storage.

## Project Structure

- `web_scraping_script.py`: The main Python script that contains the web scraping logic, including requests to retrieve web pages, parsing the HTML, and saving the scraped data.
- `Data`: The directory where the scraped data is stored (typically in CSV format or JSON).
- `Notebooks`: This directory may contain Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the scraping process in a step-by-step fashion for specific websites.

## Key Features

- `HTML Parsing`: Using BeautifulSoup to parse HTML pages and extract relevant data based on tags, classes, or attributes.
- `Handling Pagination`: Automatically scraping multiple pages of a website using pagination logic.
- `Data Storage`: Storing scraped data in structured formats like CSV or JSON for further analysis.
- `Error Handling`: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms in case of failed requests or blocked access.
  
## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, if you prefer using notebooks)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ChrisChukwunyereNwaiwu/Web-Scraping.git
    cd Web-Scraping
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python web_scraping_script.py
    ```

### Usage

1. Modify the **web_scraping_script.py** file to scrape data from your desired website by changing the target URL and the specific HTML elements to be scraped.
2. Run the script and review the scraped data stored in the **Data** directory.

### Notes

- Be mindful of the legal and ethical guidelines when scraping websites. Always check the website's `robots.txt` file and ensure that your scraping activities comply with their policies.
- Handle dynamic websites (with content rendered using JavaScript) by using additional libraries like `Selenium` or `Scrapy`.

## Future Work

- Add scraping support for JavaScript-heavy websites using `Selenium` or `Scrapy`.
- Integrate proxy management to avoid IP blocks.
- Automate scraping tasks on a schedule using cron jobs or task schedulers.
